# TimeStamp MicroService

1. Pass a string as a parameter into the url, and it will check whether it is a Unix timestamp or a natural language date.

2. If it is, the API will return both the Unix timestamp and the natural language date.

3. If it is not a valid timestamp or date, the API will return null for both properties.
